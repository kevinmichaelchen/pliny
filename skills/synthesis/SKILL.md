# Research Synthesis

## Report Structure

A good research report follows this structure:

### Executive Summary (2-3 paragraphs)
- Lead with the most important findings
- Cover the breadth of what was researched
- Note any significant caveats or limitations

### Subtopic Sections
For each researched subtopic:
- **Summary**: 1-2 sentence overview
- **Key Findings**: Bulleted list with source attribution
- **Analysis**: Deeper discussion connecting findings
- **Sources**: List of specific tools/URLs that contributed

### Coverage Notes
- What was explored thoroughly
- What gaps remain
- What the critic flagged as needing more investigation

## Source Attribution

Always attribute findings to their sources:
- `[Source: mcp__perplexity__perplexity_search_web]` — for web search results
- `[Source: mcp__deepwiki__ask_question, repo: owner/repo]` — for repo analysis
- `[Source: mcp__exa__web_search_exa]` — for semantic search results
- `[Source: claude_code]` — for codebase analysis
- `[Source: codex]` — for code generation/analysis

## Synthesis Best Practices

1. **Cross-reference**: Don't trust a single source. When multiple sources agree, confidence is higher.
2. **Note contradictions**: When sources disagree, present both views and note the contradiction.
3. **Prioritize recency**: For fast-moving topics, prefer more recent sources.
4. **Distinguish facts from opinions**: Mark speculative or opinion-based content clearly.
5. **Progressive refinement**: Update the report as new findings come in, don't wait until the end.
